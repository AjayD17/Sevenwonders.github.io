                                <p class="Description"> The Great Wall of China is a huge barrier that spans thousands of miles along China’s historic northern border. Created over millennia, the wall began its life as a series of smaller walls dating back to the 7th century BCE, built as protective barriers against nomadic raids. In 220 BCE, China’s first Emperor Qin Shi Huang masterminded the unification of all China’s walls into one almighty barrier, strengthening and extending the wall to keep out northern invaders. Today the wall is recognized as one of the seven wonders, which, including all its branches, measures a whopping 13,171 miles. </p>

The largest amphitheater ever built, it was constructed from sand and stone over eight years, from AD72 to AD80. The colossal structure could hold 80,000 spectators, arranged in a circular ring around the central stage. Dramatic and sometimes horrifying events took place here, not just gladiatorial games, but also Classical plays, animal hunts and executions. Some say water was even pumped into the arena to enact mock sea battles. </p>

A marble tomb in the center is surrounded by 42 acres of grounds, where gardens, a mosque, guest house and pool complete the complex. The entire project took over 22 years to complete by 20,000 workers at a cost of 32 million rupees. </p>

                                <p class="Description"> Machu Picchu is a lost treasure of the 15th century, a rare citadel discovered high in the Andes mountains above the Peruvian Sacred Valley. Astonishingly, it is one of the only pre-Columbian ruins found nearly intact, featuring evidence of former plazas, temples, agricultural terraces and homes. Archaeologists believe the citadel was built as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti in around 1450 in polished drystone walls. The Incas abandoned the site a century later and it remained hidden for millennia, before being brought to public attention by American historian Hiram Bingham in 1911. </p>
